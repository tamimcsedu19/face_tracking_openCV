# face_tracking_openCV
I still don't know how to add licensing (or don't care) feel free to do anything.
This is our hardware project. A facetracking camera. 

Used Material:
1) arduino
2) 2x servos
3)webcam
4)Intel core-i-5 with ubuntu-14.04
5)opencv

1) at facetrack is a codeblocks  project folder with source files and classifiers just import the project into codeblocks
2) at arduino folder , the source for arduino serial communication. Upload this code to arduino
3) Tried to write project progress at project_progress_description.html file. But I was too lazy.


Feel free to improve the code for detection and give me pull request. Thank you.
